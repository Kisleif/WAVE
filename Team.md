### Prof. Dr. Celine Hadziioannou

| ![celine-hadziioannou](/assets/images/Team/celine-hadziioannou-round.png) | **Coordinator**<br><br> **Affiliation:** University of Hamburg<br><br> **Website:** [celine.hadzii.com](https://celine.hadzii.com), [UHH Seismology](https://www.geo.uni-hamburg.de/en/geophysik/forschung/seismology.html)<br><br> **Publications:** [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=en&user=WvhdbrgAAAAJ)<br><br> **Interests:** Prof. Dr. Celine Hadziioannou is fascinated by exploring the information contained in seismic signals recorded in the absence of earthquakes, during seismically quiet times. Usually, these signals, which compose over 90% of seismic recordings worldwide, are discarded as ‘noise’. It turns out, however, that they consist of seismic waves, which carry the imprint of the sources that generated them, and of the material that they passed through. Prof. Hadziioannou is interested in “listening” to this noise with new sensor types such as DAS, using it to monitor changes in the subsurface and buildings, and understanding the sources of seismic noise.<br><br> **Collaborations:**<br>- [SPIN](https://spin-itn.eu/), an Innovative Training Network (ITN) funded by the European Commission (Horizon 2020), which focuses on using the latest ground-motion sensing technology to improve the monitoring of geohazards. |

### Antonia Kiel

| ![antonia-kiel](/assets/images/Team/antonia_kiel_round.png) | **Affiliation:** Institute of Geophysics, University of Hamburg<br><br> **Interests:** Antonia Kiel works in the field of seismology and machine learning. In the context of the CLICCS excellence cluster of the University of Hamburg, she worked on monitoring shallow groundwater in the urban area using [ambient seismic noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IATkjy-sdA&t=402s). Using the distributed acoustic sensing data of the WAVE project, she compared different unsupervised clustering methods to detect different noise sources at the fiber, coming up with a workflow under what circumstances a particular clustering method should be used.<br><br> **Collaborations:**<br>- [CLICCS](https://www.cliccs.uni-hamburg.de/de.html) |

Most recently, Dr. Bauer has utilized machine learning methods for wavefield separation and for the prediction of earthquake waveforms.<br><br> **Collaborations:**<br>- ErUM-WAVE |

Using deep learning and seismic interferometry, he worked on determining transfer functions of seismic data. His current work focuses on applying machine learning methods to large distributed acoustic sensing datasets with the aim of automatically detecting and classifying different types of seismic signals. |

Since environmental impacts of seismic and acoustic noise on accelerators can be severe, even a limiting factor for certain accelerator parameters, research using seismometers and iDAS to better understand, predict, and ideally mitigate vibrational noise sources has become a new research focus in the accelerator beam controls group MSK. |
